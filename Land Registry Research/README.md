## Project: "Land Registry Research"

### Description:
#### Scripts to automate the monotonous clicking involved in copying and pasting appropriate values into Excel when researching land records using regular expressions and the pyautogui module. Due to RODO it is not possible to show how the program works on real data. Scripts shorten work about 5 times. Due to the occurrence of captcha, 2 scripts were created, where one works until the captcha appears and the second from the moment the captcha was passed.
#####Due to the fact that the website is in Polish language (using regular expressions with elements of Polish language), the scripts in any part were translated into English.
