## Project: "Land Registry Research"

### Description:
#### Scripts to automate the monotonous clicking involved in copying and pasting appropriate values into Excel when researching land records using regular expressions (re) and the pyautogui and pyperclip modules. Due to RODO it is not possible to show how the program works on real data. Scripts shorten work about 5-10 times.  Due to the fact that the website is in Polish language (using regular expressions with elements of Polish language), the script in every part is in Polish.
